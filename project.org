* type-directed search
** every component is a pure function a -> b -> (c -> d) -> ... -> Component st
** builder infers from type signature which components fit
** click on "placeholder" (i.e. a (a -> ... -> Component st) argument), show which components fit
** when connecting components, only show fitting data sources in side bar
** when dragging component from side bar, only show fitting placeholders in UI
