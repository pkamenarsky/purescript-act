* TODO
** ExternalComponent?
** draw argument connections externally?
** DONE disallow incompatible type connections
** DONE type inference
* type-directed search
** every component is a pure function a -> b -> (c -> d) -> ... -> Component st
** builder infers from type signature which components fit
** click on "placeholder" (i.e. a (a -> ... -> Component st) argument), show which components fit
** when connecting components, only show fitting data sources in side bar
** when dragging component from side bar, only show fitting placeholders in UI
* split UI
** need Maybe Substitution? would Placeholder work?
** compute unification from substitution, else unification stays forever
* kontinuum-backend
** cheap snapshots when storing copies of data
** map<a, map<b, [c]>> should work reliably
* questions
** server-side logic?
*** could it be subsumed by permissions only?
** loading indicators?
** analytics
*** semantic reasoning
**** all delete components in a list component are tracked as one or separately
*** automatically track changes to components and preserve semantics
**** i.e. move login button into some other component, still login button
** version control
*** track changes to data model
**** automatically infer migrations
